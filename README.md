# ðŸ§ª TypeScript OOP Lab: HR Management System

## Lab Description

In this advanced lab, you will design and implement a scalable HR system using TypeScript's class-based features. You'll simulate business logic like authentication, promotions, team hierarchies, salary validation, and report generation.

---

## Learning Goals
- Use TypeScript classes, access modifiers, getters/setters
- Implement inheritance, interfaces, and static methods
- Model real-world entities and rules using clean code

---

## Instructions

1. Start with the provided `lab-starter.ts`.
2. Complete all class definitions as guided in the comments.
3. Test your system by implementing the execution scenario in the bottom of the file.
4. Compile the TypeScript using `tsc main.ts --target es2020` or run with `ts-node`.

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- `abstract class`, `implements`, `extends`
- `private`, `protected`, `readonly`, `public`
- Static methods
- Real-world modeling using enums and interfaces

Happy coding! ðŸš€
